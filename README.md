My Codeforces problems solutions

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to various programming problems from the Codeforces platform. Codeforces is a popular competitive programming website where users can participate in contests, solve algorithmic problems, and improve their coding skills.

In this repository, you'll find solutions to a wide range of Codeforces problems, organized by contest and problem ID. Each solution is implemented in C++, along with a brief explanation of the problem and the approach used to solve it.

Whether you're preparing for programming contests, practicing algorithmic problem-solving, or simply looking for solutions to specific problems, this repository aims to provide a valuable resource. Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from them, and contribute your own solutions if you have alternative approaches or optimizations.
